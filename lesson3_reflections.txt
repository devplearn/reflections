When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you want to backup local copy to online and want to give access to others then 
  you can use remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   it's not a good idea (effecient) to have every commit synced cause. Better to batch it up
