When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you want to backup local copy to online and want to give access to others then 
  you can use remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   it's not a good idea (effecient) to have every commit synced cause. Better to batch it up

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks copy of existing repository on github which also gives credit to the 
	initial person. This way we can make changes to our version without affecting the 
	main persons contribution
	clones  copy of existing repository from github to local  or local to local
	but cant update origin unless you have permission
	branches this is within a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	you will know all the changes the other person has done so it's accessbile offline
	and can work on the diff and merge to avoid conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	it would be hard to work on it without git or github. File a request to the user
	to make the changes and have them make the change which is a lenghty process

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	when changes from others are being made online and we make changes offline at around
	same time
